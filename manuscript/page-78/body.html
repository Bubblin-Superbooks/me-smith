He never did before. He knows I would worry; besides, he didn’t take a horse, and he never would walk ten miles when there are horses to ride. His gun isn’t here, so he must have gone hunting, but he wouldn’t stay all night hunting rabbits; and he couldn’t be lost, when he knows the country as well as you or me.”</p><p>“He go to visit,” the Indian woman insisted doggedly.</p><p>“If he isn’t home to-morrow, I’m goin’ to hunt him, but I know something’s wrong.”</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
