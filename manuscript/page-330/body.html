He’s goin’ to make a run for it! He’s headed for the house. He can run like a scared wolf!”</p><p>“Do they mean to kill him?” McArthur asked in a shocked voice.</p><p>“Sure they mean to kill him. Do you think that’s target practice? But look where the dust flies up—they’re striking all around him—behind him—beside him—everywhere but in him! They’re so anxious that they’re shootin’ wild. Runnin’ Rabbit ought to get him—he’s a good shot! He <em>did</em>! No, he stumbled. He’s charmed—that Smith. He’s got a strong medicine.”</p><p>“He’s not too brave to run,” said McArthur, but added: “I ran, myself, when they were after me.”</p><p>“He’d better run,” Susie replied. “But he’s after his gun; he means to fight.”</p><p>“He’ll make it!” McArthur cried.</p></div> </div>
